# .mcmeta Generator
Generates .mcmeta files based on a folder of input images and an mcmeta file to duplicate.

- Insert texture's into ``/textures/``
- Set ``default.mcmeta`` to the file structure you're trying to duplicate
- Run ``run.bat`` to run the script

You can input as many textures as you like into ``/textures/``, check the demo texture contained in ``/textures/`` for an example.
Running the script once will generate the ``/mcmetas/`` folder.
